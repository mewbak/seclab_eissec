measure: contains files developed to measure performance of approach, especially
         to get at the overhead of fork/clone/undo etc.

nconsolve: new design of constraint solver should be developed here, but
           as of now, contains outdated stuff (11/20/13).

Files
------

cons_solve.{c,h}: constraint solver API (C)
{n,}cons_solv.P: {new, old} version of the constraint solver (Prolog)
replaycs.c: Logs interactions with the constraint solver, and can replay them.
t*.c: Test programs (to test the API and solver)
